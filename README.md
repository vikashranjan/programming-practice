# programming-practice

## Aim
The aim of these exercises is to work through/understand several
dynamic programs, and also to generate some new problems in the space. 

## Process
For each of the problems solved, we will also indicate the following
* How to generate sample instances
* Set up unit tests for the code, using the `unittest` framework.
* Related problems.

## Dynamic Programming Problems
Problems covered so far: 
* Common Recurrences:
  * [computing binomial coefficients.](https://github.com/sambuddha-roy/programming-practice/blob/master/dp/binom.py)
  * [computing fibonacci numbers.](https://github.com/sambuddha-roy/programming-practice/blob/master/dp/fib.py)
* [Max subarray sum and its extensions.](https://github.com/sambuddha-roy/programming-practice/blob/master/dp/maxsumpoly.py)
